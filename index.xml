      <description>This post is the first entry in a diary of my trials and errors in creating visualizations for my doctoral thesis.
In summary: I have an excel table with several thousands of figurative language examples in Latvian, which are coded with 0 and 1 values that correspond with specific metaphor categories. I&amp;rsquo;m working on visualizations in order to make all the data simple to percieve, available to others, and - hopefully in the future - interactive.</description>

      <description>It dawned on me just now that I&amp;rsquo;ve already learnt about the dependencies of the digital world the hard way. Last year, I was working on a sheet music edition. The process was a completely new experience, and I had no idea how to get things done. So I built my workflow from scratch and learnt some bitter lessons about the digital dependencies.
The first step was about scraping all Riga archives to get my hands on every possible edition of the 24 piano preludes by the composer Jānis Medinš.</description>
